# BirdOne

One-line layout for Thunderbird: tabs and unified toolbar share a single
row, global search hidden (use CTRL+K).

> Tested on Thunderbird 152 (Supernova UI, 115+ required) on Windows.

> This project has two branches:
> 
> `main` with the custom gruvbox colors from FoxOne  
> 
> `One` &nbsp; without the custom colors - just the layout

### Features

>- Tab bar and unified toolbar merged into one row: tabs on the left, toolbar buttons on the right, next to the window controls
>- Responsive: below 850px window width the layout falls back to the default two-row interface
>- Fixed amber accent (`#fabd2f`) decoupled from the Windows accent colour – selection highlights, primary button and focus rings stayamber regardless of the OS setting
>- Colour as signal (dark mode): context menus, app menu, toolbar icons, column headers, recipient pills and compose-window controls answer hover with amber text/icons instead of a background block.
>- Message list selection, the "New Message" button and the header/compose toolbar buttons use a subtle amber tint with a 1px amber outline instead of a solid amber block
>- Square popup corners: no rounded inner corners in context menus and panels
>- Window controls (dark mode): minimize/maximize hover in amber glyph colour instead of a grey block; close keeps the Windows close-red, as glyph colour instead of a red block
>- One surface grey (dark mode): folder pane, message list, reading pane and the dark-reader mail body share a single grey (`#282828`, `--birdone-surface`) instead of the mixed near-black defaults

### Installation
>
>1. Download [`userChrome.css`](https://github.com/Firnschnee/BirdOne/blob/main/userChrome.css) and [`userContent.css`](https://github.com/Firnschnee/BirdOne/blob/main/userContent.css)
>
>2. In Thunderbird go to **Settings → General**, scroll to the bottom and open **Config Editor**. Search for
   **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`** and set it to **`true`**.
>
>3. Recommended: in the same Config Editor set **`mail.tabs.autoHide`** to **`false`**, so the tab bar (and with it the one-line layout) is always visible, even with a single tab.
>
>4. Find your profile folder: **Help → Troubleshooting Information → Profile Folder → Open Folder**.
>
>5. Create a `chrome` folder inside the profile folder if it doesn't exist, then copy `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` into it.
>
>6. Restart Thunderbird. The layout applies on restart.

### Customisation
>BirdOne is configurable through CSS variables. See all options → [docs/customisation.md](docs/customisation.md)
