# Customisation

All knobs live at the top of `userChrome.css`:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--birdone-tab-share` | `55%` | Share of the row given to the tabs |
| `--birdone-row-height` | `34px` | Height of the combined row |
| `--birdone-tab-inset` | `42px` | Left offset of the tabs (keeps the spaces button clear) |
| `--birdone-accent` | `#fabd2f` | Accent colour replacing the Windows accent |
| `--birdone-accent-text` | `#1a1a1a` | Text on accent surfaces (e.g. the "New Message" button) |
| `--birdone-surface` | `#282828` | Pane grey in dark mode (folder pane, message list, reading pane, compose fields) |
| `--birdone-titlebar` | `#1f1f1f` | Title/toolbar rows (main & compose window) and settings sidebar in dark mode |
| `--birdone-menu` | `#222222` | App menu (hamburger) surface in dark mode, matching the Windows menu grey |

The responsive breakpoint (850px) is hard-coded because media queries
can't read CSS variables. To change it, adjust both `@media (min-width: 850px)`
values in the file.

`userContent.css` (mail body and compose editor in dark mode) can't read variables
from `userChrome.css` – content documents live in a separate world. It
carries the surface grey as a plain hex; when changing `--birdone-surface`,
change it there too.
